# To-do-list
A to-do list is a tool used to organize and prioritize tasks and activities that need to be completed within a specific timeframe. It serves as a reminder and a roadmap to help individuals stay focused and productive.

You can mark each task as done, hide done tasks, delete a single task/tasks or start the whole list from the beginning by resetting and deleting all the tasks you have done so far, as per below short demonstration:
